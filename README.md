This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) on client side and with [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) on the server side.

### Running project

To run the application, go to /server and /client directories from seperate terminal sessions.

First get the dependencies by running `yarn install` or `npm install` in both folders. Then, run `yarn start` or `npm start` for each to start the project.

The client side will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the server will run on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). If there are any previous processes running on 9000 port, stop it before running the application.

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser that allows CORS.
